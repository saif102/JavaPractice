Barking Dog

We have a dog that likes to bark. We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!

Problem Statement:
  Write a method shouldWakeUp that has 2 parameters.
  
    1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking. It represents if our dog is currently barking.
    2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has a valid range of 0-23.
    
We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours so in that case returen true.

In all other cases returen false.

If the hourOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 rerturn false.
