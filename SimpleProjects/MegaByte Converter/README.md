MegaByte Converter

Problem Statement:
  Write a method called printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes that has 1 parameter of type int with the name kiloBytes.
  
The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the megabytes and remaining kilobytes from the 
kilobytes parameter.

Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX KB = YY MB and ZZ KB".

  XX represents the original value in kiloBytes.
  YY represents the calculated megabytes.
  ZZ represents the calculated remaining kilobytes.
  
If the parameter kiloBytes is less than 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".
