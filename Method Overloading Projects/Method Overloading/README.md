 Method Overloading
 
 // Create a method called calcFeetAndInchesToCentimeters
        // It needs to have two parameters.
        // feet is the first parameter, inches is the 2nd parameter
        //
        // You should validate that the first parameter feet is >= 0
        // You should validate that the 2nd parameter inches is >=0 and <=12
        // return -1 from the method if either of the above is not true
        //
        // If the parameters are valid, then calculate how many centimetres
        // comprise the feet and inches passed to this method and return
        // that value.
        //
        // Create a 2nd method of the same name but with only one parameter
        // inches is the parameter
        // validate that its >=0
        // return -1 if it is not true
        // But if its valid, then calculate how many feet are in the inches
        // and then here is the tricky part
        // call the other overloaded method passing the correct feet and inches
        // calculated so that it can calculate correctly.
